Description: Conveniently processes twitter text corpuses. Functionalities include removing re-tweets, twitter handles and URLs. The function also processes case, numeric digits, punctuation, whitespaces, and special characters. Corpuses can be easily converted to a Document Term Matrix, which is a format compatible with the majority of natural language processing techniques in R.
